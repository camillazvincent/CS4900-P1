Computational Geometry Project

In this project, we were able to represent points, line segments, and circles using the matplotlib libary. Our project can perform the following functions:

1. Intersection: Find the intersections between a given set of line segments.
2. Closest pair: Given a set of points, find the two with the smallest distance from each other.
3. Convex hull: Given a set of points, find the smallest convex polyhedron/polygon containing all the points, represented as the set of points on the polygon edge.
4. Largest empty circle: Given a set of points, find a largest circle with its center inside of their convex hull and enclosing none of them.

To run this project, start with the main file, 'main.py'. You will be prompted to select what you would like to do, and then you will be asked to choose the points you would like to test. Each run should terminate after your desired calculation and plot.

We used branches/merges, source control, and version planning to complete this project.
